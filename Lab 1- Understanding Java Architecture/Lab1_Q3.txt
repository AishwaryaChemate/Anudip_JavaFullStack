Why is Java known as a platform independent language?

1.Java program can be write one time and run multiple times on different platform without any modification to program. 
2.Java doesn't produce machine-specific binary code. Instead, the bytecode is a standardized set of instructions that the JVM can understand.
3.Since the bytecode is the same regardless of the platform.
4.You can take your compiled Java program (the .class files) and run it on any system that has a compatible JVM. 
5.The JVM on that system will interpret the bytecode and execute it using the machine-specific instructions.
6.That is why java is known as a platform independent language.
